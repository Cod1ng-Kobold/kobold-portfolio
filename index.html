        <p>
            I am Jules O'Neale. I am an aspiring coder and website designer. 
            I have multiple projects, both complete and underway.
            Most projects in this Portfolio were completed during my time in the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp.

<!--
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
